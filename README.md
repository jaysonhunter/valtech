#valtech UI exercise
==============================

Approach
--------
Upon reviewing this rather straight forward exercise, one had to make a few assumptions given that there was no design to work from. I have taken the liberty to ensure everything displays well on all devices at any breakpoint.

As this task is to prove my coding ability and ability to take a problem and break it down into smaller pieces, I have applied the Atomic Design principles across my code.


The most important aspects for me included:

- Good file structure
- Use of sematic HTML
- Decouple content from HTML
- Ensure the code is DRY
- Adhere to separation of concern
- Create modular, reusable code
- Implement a good build system
- Use good CSS naming convention (BEM)

As you and your client expect a high level of experience and coding ability, I do hope that the above sufficiently delivers on those expectations.



To build the various exercises
-------------------------------

Exercise #1:

npm i
grunt serve

Exercise #2 and #3 can be checked out without running 'npm i', just run 'grunt serve'.- `test.css`

The header section should contain a navigation bar with three links:

- Home ( index.html )
- About ( /about )
- Blog ( /blog )

Exercise #2
-----------
Style the header in whatever way you think suits.

In the content section of index.html build the following design.

Exercise #3
-----------
Add a new link to the header called "sidebar", when clicked on will show/hide the sidebar with a transition effect.
